# kronosfix

A collection of helper scripts to make kronos timekeeping a little more usable

## Adding Project Descriptions
If you have more than a couple of project codes in your timesheet this might be useful:

* Put [this file](AddProjectDescription.txt) on your desktop, open it and edit the table at the top to reflect your own projects

* Go to [Bookmarklet Maker](https://caiorss.github.io/bookmarklet-maker/)

  - Paste the contents of the edited file into the `Code` window
  - Hit `Generate Bookmarklet`
  - Copy what shows up in `Output`
 
* In Chrome
  - Right click on the bookmarks bar and select `Add Page`
  - Give it a name, say `Fix Kronos Descriptions` and paste the results you got from above into URL field (delete what was there before)
 

* Navigate to you timesheet then click the new bookmark to add descriptions to project codes

## Copying previous period's projects to current time period
* Add the contents of [this file](GetLastPayperiodCodesBookmarklet.txt) to another bookmark, call it `Copy Kronos Codes from Last period`
* Navigate to the new blank `Current Pay Period` page in Kronos and click the bookmark to copy previous period's project codes to the current period
